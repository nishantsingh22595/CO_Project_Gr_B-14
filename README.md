Including code
1. Include the assembler code in the directory for Simple-Assembler. 
2. Include the assembler run instructions in Simple-Assembler/run.
3. Update the SimpleSimulator directory with the simulator code. 
4. Include the assembler execution directives in SimpleSimulator/run.

Ensure that the simulator and the assembler both read from stdin.
Ensure that the simulator and the assembler both output to stdout.

How to assess:
1. Open the run file in the automatedTesting directory, passing the appropriate settings as inputs.
2. Alternatives for automated testing include:
Prints: 
verbose output with the --verbose option 
--no-asm options do not evaluate the assembler 
--no-sim options do not evaluate the simulator
